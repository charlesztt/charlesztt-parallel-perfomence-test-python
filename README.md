===========================================

This python code is only used to test parallel performance of a multicore system. I don't care much about if the result of clustering is correct. I will maintain the Parallel Clustering Toolbox instead.

Please install Parallel Python first. Go to www.parallelpython.com to download and install it first.

One more thing to say is how to uninstall pp, delete the ppserver.py under /usr/local/bin, and delete all pp* related files from /usr/local/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/
